== Deploy a Quarkus MicroService with Helm

_15 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this section you will learn about deploying microservices using Helm Charts.

image::coolstore-arch-inventory-quarkus.png[CoolStore Architecture,400]

link:https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/helm[Helm^] is a package manager for Kubernetes which helps users create templated packages called Helm Charts to include all Kubernetes resources that are required to deploy a particular application.  Helm then assists with installing the Helm Chart on Kubernetes, and afterwards it can upgrade or rollback the installed package when new versions are available.

image::quarkus-logo.png[Quarkus, 500]

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot,
crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

**Container First**: https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] tailors your application for GraalVM and HotSpot. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory
(not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms
like Kubernetes. We use a technique we call https://quarkus.io/container-first/[compile time boot^].

**Unifies Imperative and Reactive**: Combine both the familiar https://quarkus.io/continuum/[imperative code and the non-blocking reactive style^] when developing applications

**Developer Joy**: A cohesive platform for optimized developer joy:

* Unified configuration
* Zero config, live reload in the blink of an eye
* Streamlined code for the 80% common usages, flexible for the 20%
* No hassle native executable generation

**Best of Breed Libraries and Standards**: Quarkus brings a cohesive, fun to use full-stack framework by leveraging best of breed libraries you
love and use wired on a https://quarkus.io/standards/[standard backbone^].
--

Next, we will use Helm to deploy the `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/inventory-quarkus` application.

* Go to your Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift (the Web UI tab) and select **Helm** from the left hand side menu:

image::access-helm.png[Access Helm,600,600,align="center"]

* Click on **Install a Helm Chart from the developer catalog** link.
* Type `Quarkus` in the input field associated with search function and click on the result found.

image::helm-quarkus.png[Quarkus, 500]

* Click the **Install Helm Chart** button and follow the next steps to adjust the chart values.
* Change the release name to `inventory-quarkus`

image::inventory-quarkus.png[Inventory Quarkus,600,600,align="center"]

* Go to the **Build** section and expand it. Copy and paste the name of the repo: `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/inventory-quarkus.git`

image::build-repo.png[URI to repo,600,600,align="center"]

* Finally, click **Install** button to have your charts installed.

== Deploy a Spring Boot Microservice

_20 MINUTES EXERCISE_

In this section you will learn about deploying microservices using drag-and-drop feature of OpenShift Web Console.

image::coolstore-arch-catalog-spring-boot.png[CoolStore Architecture,400]


[sidebar]
--
image::spring-boot-logo.png[Spring Boot, 400]

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based
applications with embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertow
that you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar**. Spring Boot also allows producing a war
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.
--

This exercise starts by going to your `OpenShift Dev Spaces` and create a new workspace using the following repository URL as input `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/catalog-spring-boot.git` via **Quick Add**:

[.mt-4.center]
image::dev-spaces-quick-add-create-workspace.png[Quick Add to Create Workspace]

Then click **Create & Open** button to import the project.

NOTE: You might be asked to login through link:https://github.com[GitHub.com^] with your user in order to access OpenShift Dev Spaces. This is due the GitHub OAuth plugin available in OpenShift Dev Spaces that let start using GitHub features such as Pull Requests, Issues etc from the environment.

[.mt-4.center]
image::dev-spaces-import-from-git.png[Import Workspace from Git Repository]

The import will generate a developer workspace containing the language support for Spring Boot and pre-built run configurations for building the app.

The format to define these workspaces is the link:https://devfile.io/docs/2.1.0/what-is-a-devfile[Devfile^], a standard format to record the instructions for configuring and running your build environment as a YAML-formatted text file.

In the while your workspace is setup, you can review the Devfile available on the Catalog service repository link:https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/catalog-spring-boot/blob/main/devfile.yaml[here^].

    ]
}
----

TIP: OpenShift Dev Spaces plugins are compatible with VSCode, see a list of available plugins from Red Hat link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/redhat[here].  

After your workspace is up and running, locate the `/projects/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/resources/import.sql` file in the newly imported project:

[.mt-4.center]
image::che-project-explorer-locate-file.png[Locate File in Project Explorer]

INSERT INTO PRODUCT (item_id, name, description, price) VALUES ('165623', 'Organic Cotton knit socks', 'Your brand will get noticed on these full color knit socks. Imported.',4.15);
----

[.mt-4.center]
image::che-editor-add-lines.png[Add lines in Editor Window]

Next go to **Terminal** -> **Run Tasks..**  and select **maven-build**

[.mt-4.center]
image::run-maven.png[Run Maven build]

You should see a new terminal opening with the output of the build as follows:

[.mt-4.center]
image::devspaces-maven-build.png[Run Maven build in Dev Spaces]

TIP: You can also do it via CLI as follows: go to **Terminal** -> **Open Terminal in Specific Container** and select a container with name **tools**.
A terminal window will open at the bottom of your editor and there you can input Maven commands such as `mvn clean install`.

image::universal-devimage-container-run-mvn.png[Run Maven in Terminal]

After packaging the application, you can expand your target folder on left-hand side and observe the results:

image::build-results.png[Build results,600,600,align="center"]

You should download the build results by right-clicking and saving the jar on your local computer.
In order to deploy our recent build we will use this downloaded jar.

* Go back to the **Topology view** of your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`
* Drag and drop the downloaded JAR into the Topology

image::drag-and-drop.png[Drag and Drop JAR,600,600,align="center"]

Or:

* Click on +Add` button and locate the `Upload JAR File` option

image::upload-jar.png[Upload jar,600,600,align="center"]

Then:

* In the Upload JAR file dialog, browse the location of the jar from your local computer and modify the *`Builder Image Version`* to be `openjdk-11-el7`. Optionally, you can also modify the *`Runtime icon`* to `spring-boot`.

image::upload-jar-file-dialog-settings-1.png[JAR Upload Dialog,600,600,align="center"]

* In the *`General Section`* choose `Create Application` from the *`Application`*  drop-down , use `coolstore` as the *`Application name`* and set the *`Name`* to `catalog-spring-boot`:

image::upload-jar-file-dialog-settings-2.png[JAR Upload Dialog,600,600,align="center"]

* Press the **Create** button.

You can validate your deployment by accessing the application via its route url:

image::route.png[Route,600,600,align="center"]

This will open a new browser tab and you should see something similar to:

image::test-it.png[Test it,600,600,align="center"]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have a similar array of json output:

== Deploy Gateway Service using YAML

_10 MINUTES EXERCISE_

During this section you will deploy a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs using Eclipse Vert.x

[sidebar]
--
image:vertx-logo.png[Vertx, 400]

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is a toolkit for building reactive applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Vert.x does not 
impose a specific framework or packaging model and can be used within your existing applications and frameworks 
in order to add reactive functionality by just adding the Vert.x jar files to the application classpath.

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] enables building reactive systems as defined by http://www.reactivemanifesto.org[The Reactive Manifesto^] and build 
services that are:

* *Responsive*: to handle requests in a reasonable time
* *Resilient*: to stay responsive in the face of failures
* *Elastic*: to stay responsive under various loads and be able to scale up and down
* *Message driven*: components interact using asynchronous message-passing

http://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x^] is designed to be event-driven and non-blocking. Events are delivered in an event loop that must never be blocked. Unlike traditional applications, Vert.x uses a very small number of threads responsible for dispatching the events to event handlers. If the event loop is blocked, the events won’t be delivered anymore and therefore the code needs to be mindful of this execution model.
--

For this type of deployment we can use YAML files already available at https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx.git.

* Go to your `Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift`.
* Click on **+Add** button and locate **From Local Machine** option, then select **From YAML**

image::from-yaml.png[From YAML, 600,600,align="center"]

* Copy the following YAML containing the Kubernetes manifests describing the API Gateway for the Coolstore. You find it also in the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/gateway-vertx/blob/main/kubernetes/gateway-vertx.yaml[here^].

== Deploy Web UI from Git

_15 MINUTES EXERCISE_

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available
in OpenShift.

In this section, you will fully use OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^].
OpenShift will obtain the application code directly from the source repository then build and deploy a
container image of it. 

In the OpenShift Web Console, from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+Add' and select 'Import from Git'*`

image::dev-view-add-git-import.png[OpenShift - Add from Git]

* In the Git Import dialog fill in the *`Git Repo URL`* with `https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/web-nodejs.git`. Next click `show advanced Git options` to update the *`Git reference`* to `main`.

image::git-import-dialog-1.png[Git Repo URL and reference, 500]

* Further below in the dialog you will see the following notes about import strategies.

image::git-import-dialog-2.png[Import Strategy, 500]

* Click **Edit Import Strategy**, select 
the *`Builder Image`* strategy and OpenShift will autodetect the runtime needed by the code, which in this case should be Node.js

image::git-import-dialog-3.png[Builder Image Strategy]

* Specify the **Application**, select `coolstore`

* Scroll down to the bottom of the dialog where you see the following options.

image::git-import-dialog-4.png[Builder Image Strategy, 600]

* Click on **Deployment** the expand the section and add an environment variable. The environment variable name is `SECURE_COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT` and the value is the URL associated with the Route to Gateway Service that you used in the previous section. 

image::git-import-dialog-5.png[Builder Image Strategy, 600]

* Press *`Create`* button to finish the deployment.


The final view of the deployed applications should be similar to this one:

image::openshift-all-deployed.png[Deployments Overview, 700]


You can also connect all microservices just from a visualization point of view as the following image: 


image::final-overview.png[Deployments Overview, 700]

You can check the deployed application by accessing the Route of the last deployment `web-nodejs`:

image::https://github.com/modernizing-java-applications-book/web-nodejs/blob/main/coolstore-web.png?raw=true[Coolstore Shop,600] 

Congrats!! You have implemented an e-store using a microservices based architecture!
